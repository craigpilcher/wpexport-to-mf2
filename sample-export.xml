It has become clear, in these last decades of decadence, decline, towering institutional violence, and rampant bad taste, that American life is stuck somewhere inside the Paul Verhoeven cinematic universe. In the bloody, satirical sci-fi films that made his name with American audiences, Verhoeven dealt in a singularly unappealing vision of the future, one both luridly inventive and careful about where not to be imaginative. “RoboCop,” from 1987, set in a futuristic Detroit, is a gleeful exaggeration of the anxieties of Reagan-era urban life: the office towers are even more isolated, and their boardrooms more brazenly sociopathic; the popular culture is a tick or two more savage and leering; the police are more overmatched and the streets more ungovernable. “Total Recall,” released in 1990 and adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick, does feature humans living on Mars, a private company that implants bespoke memories in its clients, and a brassy three-breasted space prostitute, but its vision of 2084 is in other respects familiar. Mars is dirty, violent, and unequal, and the colony is overseen by the private security force of a capitalist who has staked out a monopoly on oxygen itself. Few directors who have spent as much screen time in the future have taken as relentlessly dim a view of the prospect.

Where “RoboCop” and “Total Recall” exist in grimy, crowded, dangerous futures that look and feel like degraded versions of the already degrading present, Verhoeven’s bizarre masterwork “Starship Troopers,” from 1997, is set in the more distant days of the twenty-third century—and, it quickly emerges, long after the end of history. “This year, we explored the failure of democracy, how the social scientists brought our world to the brink of chaos,” Rasczak, a history teacher (played by the Verhoeven favorite Michael Ironside), barks at his high-school students in an early scene. “We talked about the veterans and how they took control, and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since.” Rasczak himself is a disfigured war veteran, as are all of his fellow-teachers, and their job is to steer their students toward enlisting in a galaxy-wide war against a species of giant, lethal bug. In this universe, humankind is divided into “civilians” and “citizens”; only citizens have the right to vote, and citizenship can be won only through “federal service” in the military. “Something given has no value,” [Rasczak explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvAsR4O4W0w). “When you vote, you are exercising political authority. You are using force. And force, my friends, is violence—the supreme authority from which all other authorities derive.” Daily life in the Federation may be cleaner and brighter than in any of Verhoeven’s other futures, but every ambiguity has been displaced by the certitudes, coercions, and doublespeak of endless, totalizing conflict.

To defend the Federation, some suspiciously adult-looking teens leave behind their comfortable space-bourgeois youth for a chance to earn citizenship and enjoy some adventures killing bugs on a faraway planet. We meet them at the end of their school days in Buenos Aires, and see their arena football games and glossy proms: star wide receiver Johnny (Casper Van Dien) is dating Carmen (Denise Richards), who is interested in the rival football star and rising flyboy Zander (Patrick Muldoon); Dizzy (Dina Meyer), the team’s quarterback, has an unrequited crush on Johnny; Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) is a chipper egghead who might also be psychic. Everyone is beautiful and selfish and mostly awful to each other, both in the thoughtless ways that teen-agers are and because their society is designed to channel them toward awfulness. Each of them will find a way to serve the colonial war: Johnny and Dizzy join the mobile infantry (where a drill sergeant welcomes Dizzy to the unit by pressing his knee into her throat until she falls unconscious); Carmen and Zander win spots in flight school; Carl’s gifts allow him to disappear into military intelligence.

The Federation is, to all appearances, losing the permanent war, and much of “Starship Troopers” is given over to watching the teens as they fight and die for the cause. One of Verhoeven’s main goals is to depict a society whose fixation on force has left it preening, idiotic, and paradoxically weak. This state manifests as endless columns of cultishly revered and supremely well-equipped violence workers who know how to do only one thing, and a culture that exists exclusively to celebrate their efforts. If it’s unsettling to recognize similarities between the crumbling futures of “RoboCop” and “Total Recall” and our own cultural moment, it’s terrifying how familiar the thudding martial beats of “Starship Troopers” are to contemporary ears. It’s a comedy, of course.

-=-=-=-
“It’s an idiotic story: young people go to fight bugs,” [Verhoeven told](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/22/how-we-made-starship-troopers-paul-verhoeven-nazis-leni-riefenstahl) the *Guardian* in 2018, long after the film, which met with puzzled and mostly negative reactions upon release, had undergone a full reappraisal and become a cult classic. Ed Neumeier, screenwriter of “RoboCop,” adapted “Starship Troopers” from the 1959 science-fiction novel of the same name, by Robert A. Heinlein; that book, which the director found “militaristic, if not fascistic,” was dedicated “to all sergeants anywhen who have labored to make men out of boys.” Verhoeven told *Empire*, in 2014, that he couldn’t finish reading it. With the possible exception of Mary Harron’s “American Psycho,” it’s hard to think of a film adaptation that’s more invested in refuting and satirizing its source. The anti-Fascism of “Starship Troopers” is mordant and merciless, but Verhoeven advances his argument by making its every frame lavishly, overbearingly Fascist. (When studio executives complained that the Federation’s banner was “a Nazi flag,” Verhoeven reassured them: “No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s completely different colors.”) The movie’s biggest laughs come from following ultra-hoary war-movie conventions to their most savage and illogical conclusions, but the whole project is stilted and off-putting by design. Other war films try to give viewers some humanity to hang on to. Verhoeven offers only sheer surfaces and one clenched fist after another.

And screens—lots of screens. The Federal Network has queasy affinities with Fox News, which débuted thirteen months before “Starship Troopers” arrived in theatres. Every machine-tooled chunk of media on the ubiquitous propaganda network ends with the words “Would you like to know more?” (More than YouTube’s algorithm bothers to ask.) The programming is strident and sappy in saluting the troops, and more ardent in its manic villainizing of the enemy. The debate-shaped play-fights on the Federal Network unfold along familiar beats. When a scientist suggests that the Arachnid enemy are capable of thought, her priggish interlocutor blusters, “Insects with intelligence? Have you ever met one? I can’t believe I’m hearing this nonsense.” Presented with evidence that “brain bugs” might inform the actions of the insect infantry that had just demolished the first human offensive against them, the bow-tied anti-expert pouts, “Frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks *offensive*.” The film’s climax-of-sorts also hinges on the bugs’ state of mind. When Johnny’s squadron avenges a fallen comrade with a heroic assault on a bug stronghold, Carl, now kitted out in full S.S.-officer regalia, uses his Federation-honed psychic powers to ascertain that humanity’s Arachnid enemies are now *afraid*. Everyone cheers.

Although Phil Tippett’s visual effects deliver some memorable creatures—the Arachnids attack in sudden skittering hordes, or erupt through the sand, or belch out punishment from pulsating blue bladders—the film’s broader loathsomeness flattens the impact significantly. The mobile infantry’s strategy amounts to blasting away at endless ravening waves of Arachnids, because their leaders persistently underestimate the enemy and because it’s all the space grunts have ever been trained to do. In short, the fighting isn’t much fun to watch—intentionally so, it seems. “With a title like *Starship Troopers*, people were expecting a new *Star Wars*,” Verhoeven told the *Guardian*. “They got that, but not really: it stuck in your throat. It said: ‘Here are your heroes and your heroines, but, by the way—they’re fascists.’&nbsp;” Verhoeven borrows from Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda documentaries “Olympia” and “Triumph of the Will,” not just in individual moments and shots but also in what is exalted and what is left out. The film covers Susan Sontag’s list of the ruling fetishes of Nazism, from her 1975 essay “Fascinating Fascism” (“the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community; the repudiation of the intellect”), but also slyly plays up what’s missing elsewhere. When Johnny wins a training exercise at boot camp, Verhoeven shows him triumphantly waving a flag in a backlit, low-angle shot, then matches it from another, more distant angle. The first shot is startlingly well-replicated Riefenstahl iconography. The second is just a square-jawed young jock on a platform, yelling.

For most of “Starship Troopers,” humanity, in every possible facet, gets its ass kicked. A culture that reveres and communicates exclusively through violence—a culture very much like one that responds to peaceful protests with indiscriminate police brutality, or whose pandemic strategy is to “dominate” an unreasoning virus—keeps running up against its own self-imposed limitations. Once again, the present has caught up to Verhoeven’s acid vision of the future. It’s not a realization that anyone in the film can articulate, or seemingly even process, but the failure is plain: their society has left itself a single solution to every problem, and it doesn’t work.

Donald Trump didn’t empty American politics of everything but violence; he’s just what was left afterward. He is more an emblem of American defeat than its author. The world of “Starship Troopers” aligns with our moment in its wastefulness and brutality, and most of all in being so helplessly recursive. At the end of the film, the human survivors of the bug siege become the heroes of a bombastic military-recruiting ad. A splash of onscreen text cheers, “They’ll keep fighting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they’ll win!” The second promise is extraneous. All that’s left to win is the chance to fight more, and to fight off the realization that the fighting itself has become the point.";}}s:6:"author";a:2:{s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"h-card";}s:10:"properties";a:2:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;s:10:"David Roth";}s:2:"me";a:1:{i:0;s:50:"https://the-new-yorker.com/contributor/david-roth/";}}}s:11:"publication";a:2:{s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"h-card";}s:10:"properties";a:4:{s:5:"_type";a:1:{i:0;s:12:"Organization";}s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;s:14:"The New Yorker";}s:5:"photo";a:1:{i:0;s:56:"https://www.newyorker.com/static/tny/assets/logo-seo.png";}s:3:"url";a:1:{i:0;s:25:"https://www.newyorker.com";}}}}}}]]></wp:meta_value>

My working assumptions: we’re not leaving lockdown until the end of August / beginning of September, and there will be a second wave after this, because it’ll still be too early. We’ll see layoffs even at seemingly wealthy companies. Social distancing until at least 2022.
At the time, people were telling me that I should prepare to be in lockdown for maybe another month (so, until two months ago). There had been lots of talk about everything being up and running for Easter (April 12), or for Memorial Day (May 25). My tweet looked like doom-saying pessimism.
If anything, my assessment now seems overly optimistic. The World Health Organization is now saying we'll have it under control in 3 to 5 years; Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says we won't have a vaccine until 2021 (which in itself is very fast); almost 40% of healthcare executives think a vaccine won't be made available to all until 2022. Social distancing is likely to be with us for some time to come, and with it, a real change to the way all of us live. This will be true all over the world, but particularly in the United States, where leadership and our own hubris have continued to spectacularly fail us.
Here in the US, 73% of companies plan to keep at least some workers permanently remote; 30 million people lost their jobs because of the pandemic; at the time of writing we're in the last week of the $600/week of federal unemployment benefits (unless Congress extends this help). No matter what happens next, the effect of this era will be felt for generations.
Unfortunately, this is particularly true in communities of color. Indigenous and Black Americans are five times more likely than white Americans to be hospitalized because of the virus. Hispanic or Latinx Americans are four times more likely than white Americans.
We should have been mentally preparing ourselves for a long pandemic this whole time. Assuming these figures hold, the following is true for the foreseeable:
We are not going back to the office.
We are not going to resume the same kind of social activities we're used to.
We are not going to conferences, or to the movies, or to conventions.
We are going to need to adapt.
It's difficult to imagine how we would have coped before the internet. For the last few decades, it's slowly become ingrained in all of our lives. For the last few months, it's become the way all of our lives can operate: famously through Zoom (which is now worth 78X its revenue), but also Slack, Facebook, and all of the apps and services that keep us in touch with each other. All of these services were created long before Covid; it's going to be interesting to see the services people create to cope with the specific challenges of the pandemic. I am hopeful that while some of those services will be startups, others will be open source collectives of people who want to help.
It's also difficult to imagine how our current systems of care can cope. A pandemic makes clear that we are, as individuals, only as healthy as we are as a society: if lots of people have a deadly, infectious disease, I'm more likely to get it too, no matter what healthcare plan I'm on. It's in all of our interests to establish a genuine social care system that allows everyone to be safe and healthy - and in a world where millions of people continue to lose their jobs every month, it's vitally important that this safety net isn't tied to employment. Healthcare must be a human right. Housing must be a human right, with strong tenant protections. Food must be a human right. The fallacy that every single thing needs to be a free market must come to an end.
We're going through a period of major change, and we're still only on the first foothills. There's a long, hard road ahead. Surviving the next few years will mean covering new ground, and redefining a great deal of how society works.
Most importantly, we will need to finally learn to work together.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow</a>, I’ve started my now page.
Current undertaking(s)
<a href="https://pilch.me/2020/august-26/">Home matters</a> and world events have sort of put blogging in the back seat. With the latest current events, I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out ways to help. This list of <a href="https://bailfunds.github.io/">bail funds by state</a> helped tremendously.
But here, my current itch (an ongoing one) is looking at various note-taking <a href="https://pilch.me/tag/tools/">tools</a>, trying to figure out the best way to digitize my physical notebook collection. Most recent tool used was TiddlyWiki, which inspired me to <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/hosting-multiple-tiddlywikis-on-node/">set up my own</a> commonplace book <a href="https://wiki.pilch.me">here</a>. Current apple of my eye is <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-07-16-2205/">Obsidian</a>, which is all in markdown. This is making me consider a possible move to <a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a> again…
Current setup
Phone: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes">Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> (will probably write a post on this soon)
Laptop: Surface Book 2016
Notebook: Field Notes, <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/vignette">Vignette edition</a>
Media consumption
Playing: <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-09-04-2329/">Marvel’s Avengers</a> and NBA 2K20 on <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/stadia-vs-xcloud/">Stadia</a>, Stardew Valley on phone
Watching: The Last Dance on Netflix, and Doctor Who rewatch from personal collection (10th Doctor, started in series 2).

		<title>The inward (mobile) search</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had this on my mind for a few years now, and was reminded by this article about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations">Apple will reject Stadia and xCloud</a> from the App Store. I'm a fan of both of those services so far, but my thoughts are tangential to Apple's locked down platform. The nit I am picking is with search.

There is an almost throwaway line in Apple's policy about how all the games would need to be reviewed and available in search. In direct relation to this issue, the policy is dumb and will likely fold, either to antitrust inquiries or backdoor handshake deals (or both). It creates a bad user experience (people who want to use the service on iOS cannot) for the sake of a good user interface.

I can't fault them for it. In my 10 years using smartphones, I was able to switch to iOS for an entire 6 weeks, around the end of 2015. The only thing that still haunts me as an Android user is Spotlight Search.

It underscores the core design difference between the two systems. There is a single iOS which everyone experieces, but users bring along their individual stuff into the walled garden. On Android, you are generally encourged to create your own unique experience, which is rewarding in itself. However, trying to access personal items is a hassle, as search is almost always pointed outward toward the G-shaped hive mind.

I've spent several weeks organizing personal notes, experimenting with new tools. The interoperability and longevity of plaintext notes has proven particular alluring, and quite useful in practice. But if I want to perform a mobile search that includes my personal files as well as relevant emails/todos/etc., I am out of luck. The market leader to end all market leaders of internet search fails to accomplish this, and probably on purpose, because again, all search points outward by design.

Anyways, this has been bugging me for years, and won't get any better because I just got my next Android phone. On a related note, I look forward to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> coming to mobile.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday was harrowing for many reasons, and I want to write them all out for posterity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We woke at 6am to the sound of my father-in-law bailing water out of our basement, which had flooded. Water bubbling up from under our front walk - the well line had broken, so I shut off our water. Spent the next few hours drying it out. Talked to the people that installed the well, who told us he would need an excavating tool which he did not have to get through any tree roots, etc., to fix it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brief work phone call to find out our project end date has been moved up 2 months by our client, to October 1. No pressure, but not something you expect to hear very often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Occasional social media checks show someone shot 3 protesters in Kenosha, killing 2. Horrifying details emerge over the rest of the day, interspersed with hurricane and pandemic news.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Called several neighbors, checked BBB, to get names of excavators. Couldn't get ahold of anyone until mid- to late-afternoon, and no one would be able to come out today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Took a walk to blow off steam with the wife. Saw a couple small squirrels cross the road ahead of us. When we catch up to that point, we are startled by a snake who, upon further inspection, is eating one of the squirrels. Ominous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heard back from insurance company, who will cover the water damage but not the well repair (apparently a standard practice). Understandable but disappointing. Also, they have no contacts to suggest for the repair - more disappointing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wildcat strike by the Milwaukee Bucks, followed by the rest of the NBA teams on that days schedule, then WNBA, MLB, and MLS. Baller move, fills me with hope. I hope this pushes things forward in the right direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/twitter {"url":"https://twitter.com/janesports/status/1257347739626754049?s=19","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","className":""} -->

</div><figcaption>Sports are the (reward) for a functioning society</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/twitter -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's hoping August 27 is better.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" rel="nofollow ugc">nownownow</a>, I’ve started my now page.
Current undertaking(s)
<a href="https://pilch.me/2020/august-26/">Home matters</a> and world events have sort of put blogging in the back seat. With the latest current events, I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out ways to help. This list of <a href="https://bailfunds.github.io/" rel="nofollow ugc">bail funds by state</a> helped tremendously.
But here, my current itch (an ongoing one) is looking at various note-taking <a href="https://pilch.me/tag/tools/">tools</a>, trying to figure out the best way to digitize my physical notebook collection. Most recent tool used was TiddlyWiki, which inspired me to <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/hosting-multiple-tiddlywikis-on-node/">set up my own</a> commonplace book <a href="https://wiki.pilch.me" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>. Current apple of my eye is <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-07-16-2205/">Obsidian</a>, which is all in markdown. This is making me consider a possible move to <a href="https://blot.im" rel="nofollow ugc">Blot</a> again…
Current setup
Phone: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="nofollow ugc">Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> (will probably write a post on this soon)
Laptop: Surface Book 2016
Notebook: Field Notes, <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/vignette" rel="nofollow ugc">Vignette edition</a>
Media consumption
Playing: <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-09-04-2329/">Marvel’s Avengers</a> and NBA 2K20 on <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/stadia-vs-xcloud/">Stadia</a>, Stardew Valley on phone
Watching: The Last Dance on Netflix, and Doctor Who rewatch from personal collection (10th Doctor, started in series 2).

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" rel="nofollow ugc">nownownow</a>, I’ve started my now page.
Current undertaking(s)
<a href="https://pilch.me/2020/august-26/">Home matters</a> and world events have sort of put blogging in the back seat. With the latest current events, I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out ways to help. This list of <a href="https://bailfunds.github.io/" rel="nofollow ugc">bail funds by state</a> helped tremendously.
But here, my current itch (an ongoing one) is looking at various note-taking <a href="https://pilch.me/tag/tools/">tools</a>, trying to figure out the best way to digitize my physical notebook collection. Most recent tool used was TiddlyWiki, which inspired me to <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/hosting-multiple-tiddlywikis-on-node/">set up my own</a> commonplace book <a href="https://wiki.pilch.me" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>. Current apple of my eye is <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-07-16-2205/">Obsidian</a>, which is all in markdown. This is making me consider a possible move to <a href="https://blot.im" rel="nofollow ugc">Blot</a> again…
Current setup
Phone: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="nofollow ugc">Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> (will probably write a post on this soon)
Laptop: Surface Book 2016
Notebook: Field Notes, <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/vignette" rel="nofollow ugc">Vignette edition</a>
Media consumption
Playing: <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-09-04-2329/">Marvel’s Avengers</a> and NBA 2K20 on <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/stadia-vs-xcloud/">Stadia</a>, Stardew Valley on phone
Watching: The Last Dance on Netflix, and Doctor Who rewatch from personal collection (10th Doctor, started in series 2).
